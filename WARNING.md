# Warning

## Risks

Please note: this documentation has been assembled on a best-efforts basis.

IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE DOCUMENTATION OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE DOCUMENTATION.

It should be obvious that you will be taking on risk by relying on inferred documentation created on a best-efforts basis who have no affiliation with the organisation in question.

Assumptions have been made that may not hold in all circumstances. This work was based on a single system, and a limited number of test cases.  It is likely that some things may not be documented accurately. Some messages may not work as documented, or sending them to your control box may lead to operation of the system outside of normal parameters and controls, and consequently result in devices being damaged. Your expensive air conditioning unit may behave erratically, stop working, or worse.

Most people will be well served by using their system as it was originally intended, operating safely within the intended parameters.

If you decide to proceed to rely on this documentation to poke and prod at your system, you do so at your own risk.

## Additional Cautions

Please be careful if you are self-wiring the Ethernet / RS-485 connection. The ~15v DC available on the cable is no joke to sensitive electronics and could easily damage things. Shorting this out or connecting it in reverse will likely cause problems for the control box, as well as the tablet and/or whatever else you have connected.

If working with electronics like this safely is beyond your capability, don't do it. Seek help from someone who knows what they're doing.

Finally, if you do manage to damage your control box or air-con system by messing with it, don't be an ass about it. Take it on the chin and don't try to blame AA or your air-con installer or anyone else for your failure. These are decent, good, hard-working people and small businesses, and your failures are yours alone. I shouldn't need to say this, but I think it's important to be said anyway.
